[{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"A brief history of Unix In 1969 (also the year in which people went to the moon for the first time in human history) the very first version of Unix operating system was created in assembly language for the minicomputer PDP-7 at Bell Labs (9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for the work completed at this phenomenon laboratory). The PDP-7 on which Ken Thompson developed and ran the first version of Unix had a really small memory (4 kilobytes). This memory constraint was a major factor that led to the simplicity of the Unix design philosophy.\n UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity. \u0026ndash; Dennis Ritchie\n In 1971, the Unix group at Bell Labs attempted to rewrite Unix in a high level programming language so that it would be easier for them to port Unix to support other computer architectures. The B programming language was then created. It\u0026rsquo;s the work of Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. The B programming language then became the precursor to the C language, the original version of which was completed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.\nIn 1972, Thompson rewrote the Unix kernel in C. In subsequent years Unix was carried out at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB).\nMany variations were then developed and they are collectively referred to as Unix-like operating systems. Unix and Unix-like operating systems are considered as the best ever created in terms of stability, security, flexibility, scalability and elegance.\nIntroduction to Linux In 1991, Linus Torvalds (founder of Linux) while studying at the University of Helsinki (in Finland) was not happy with the MS-DOS operating system. His attempt to retrieve a free licence for Unix failed since Unix was not free. After reading the Operating Systems: Design and Implementation book by Andy Tanenbaum, the book that launched him to new heights, he decided to write his own operating system Linux. Linux eventually became one of the largest open source projects in the world.\nLinux actually is the kernel that provide the core functionalities for many operating systems that based on it. These operating systems often called Linux distribution. There are more than 200 Linux distrubitions out there among them Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Kali Linux, \u0026hellip; are most well-known.\nLinux vs Unix Linux is considered as a clone of Unix since it was developed to mimic Unix but none of it\u0026rsquo;s source code was copied from Unix source code.\nLike Unix, Linux is a multiuser, multitasking, highly flexible, secure and robust operating system.\nUnlike Unix, Linux is a free software. It was released by Linus Torvalds under GNU General Public License. Everyone is permitted to download Linux from the Internet at no cost and to use it for any desired purpose, make copies as many as desired and even redistribute it.\n Software is like sex. It\u0026rsquo;s better when it\u0026rsquo;s free. \u0026ndash; Linus Torvalds\n Linux can run on a wide range of hardware, including handheld devices (including cell phones), game machines, desktop computers, workstations, mainframes, supercomputer, industry robots and even wristwatches.\nLinux is used by individuals, corporations, goverments, academic institutions and other organizations. Since Linux\u0026rsquo;s source code is open, everyone can monitor the code for security holes or customize it to suite their need.\nPeople, especially who is studying to become computer professionals, are more and more interested in learning Linux. Having linux skills is also desirable for many programmers.\n","href":"/posts/introduction-linux/","title":"Introduction to Linux"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/linux/","title":"linux"},{"content":"","href":"/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/","title":"Programming thoughts"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/series/","title":"series"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/configuration/","title":"configuration"},{"content":"I just installed MySQL server (version 8.0) into my Ubuntu 20.04 with an empty password for the root user. It has occurred to me that the Access denied for user issue kept spinning my head.\nBecause for every project we use MySQL we always provide username and password to authenticate queries. I needed to change the password and get rid of the Access denied issue.\nSome internet user suggests that changing the password can solve the issue, like the following\nmysql\u0026gt; alter user \u0026#39;root\u0026#39;@\u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39; identified by \u0026#39;newPasswd\u0026#39;; But it didn\u0026rsquo;t in my case.\nI want to see if the password was really set.\nI know that the MySQL user information is stored in mysql.user table.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what is inside mysql.user table.\n$ sudo mysql -u root -p mysql\u0026gt; use mysql; mysql\u0026gt; desc mysql.user; mysql\u0026gt; select Host, User, authentication_string from mysql.user; The out put of the last query says that the password for the user root is empty (since the authentication_string is empty). So changing password didn\u0026rsquo;t work. But why?\nAfter doing some research, I found out that MySQL server is using something called authentication plugin to authenticate a MySQL client when it tries to connect to the server. In my case, the authentication plugin being used doesn\u0026rsquo;t support a username/password authentication method.\nLets see what plugin is being used.\nmysql\u0026gt; select User, Host, plugin from mysql.user; The out put is +------------------+-----------------------+ | User | plugin | +------------------+-----------------------+ | root | auth_socket | | mysql.sys | caching_sha2_password | | mysql.infoschema | caching_sha2_password | | mysql.session | caching_sha2_password | | debian-sys-maint | caching_sha2_password | +------------------+-----------------------+ OK, the plugin is auth_socket. It means that MySQL server will check if the client is using a Unix socket and then will compare the username. It just ignores any password provided in the connection URL.\nAfter some time, I figured that the correct way to change the password is to change it and update the authentication plugin at the same time, like in the following:\n$ alter user \u0026#39;root\u0026#39;@\u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39; identified with mysql_native_password by \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;; After that, if we double check the plugin we will see something like\n+------------------+-----------------------+ | User | plugin | +------------------+-----------------------+ | root | mysql_native_password | | mysql.sys | caching_sha2_password | | mysql.infoschema | caching_sha2_password | | mysql.session | caching_sha2_password | | debian-sys-maint | caching_sha2_password | +------------------+-----------------------+ mysql_native_password came to the light, that is the familiar old username/password way of authentication.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all. Happy coding!\n","href":"/posts/mysql-access-denied-1698/","title":"ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/mysql/","title":"mysql"},{"content":"Sooner or later as a developer, you will find yourself in a situation where you’re working using multiple Github accounts. One is your company account, one is your personal account. In this post, I’m going to share a common approach that can help you achieve that.\nWe will be using ssh as the protocol to authenticate our git requests to Github server because we do not want to enter the password each time we do a git request using username/password authentication. To use ssh we will need a ssh key pair (private/public keys) to authenticate each git request. Your public key will be stored on Github server. It acts as a lock to guard your Github repositories. To access (unlock) the repositories you will need the private key stored on your local machine and acts as the key for that lock. For that reason, you always keep your private key secured.\nGenerate ssh key pair using ssh-keygen On a Linux distribution machine like my Ubuntu machine, you can generate a ssh key pair by using the ssh-keygen command line. After you generated a key pair, you will find it under ~/.ssh directory.\nMaybe in that .ssh directory, you can find some key pairs already there generated by someone else. The key pair normally will be id_rsa for the private key, id_rsa.pub for the public key. If you’re not sure about the key pairs generated before, for example the person who created the key pairs might have secured the key pairs with a passphrase while creating it, then create a new one.\nIn order to do it, run the following command on your terminal:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u0026#34;bob@company.com\u0026#34; -f \u0026#34;id_rsa\u0026#34; When you’re prompted to enter the passphrase, leave it empty.\nThis creates a new ssh key pair, using the provided email as a label and you will find in the ~/.ssh directory 2 new generated files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub\nSimilarly, let’s generate another key pair for your personal Github account. In order to do it, run the following command on your terminal:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u0026#34;bob@gmail.com\u0026#34; -f \u0026#34;id_rsa_personal\u0026#34; On my machine, this command generates id_rsa_personal and id_rsa_personal.pub files in the current directory where I invoke the command line.\nCopy them to the ~/.ssh directory using the following command:\ncp id_rsa_personal id_rsa_personal.pub ~/.ssh  Be careful because you do not want to overwrite the key pairs generated before in the ~/.ssh directory. To simplify things for this post, I assume that the pair (id_rsa, id_rsa_public) is absent in the ~/.ssh directory.\n Copy the public key content to corresponding Github account Let’s print out on the terminal the content of the public key generated above. Run the following commands:\ncd ~/.ssh cat id_rsa.pub Then copy the output text and login to Github with your personal account. Then go to Settings \u0026gt; SSH and GPG keys \u0026gt; New SSH Key. Copy the output text and paste to the text area on Github. Name it, for example, \u0026ldquo;key generated using company A’s laptop\u0026rdquo;.\nRegister generated key pairs with ssh-agent The ssh-agent acts like a keychain that is responsible for holding the private keys. In addition to holding private keys it also handles signing the authentication data using private keys.\nBefore adding the new SSH key to the ssh-agent, ensure the ssh-agent is running by executing the following command:\neval \u0026#34;$(ssh-agent -s)\u0026#34; Now when the ssh-agent is running, executing the following commands will add the new SSH key to the local ssh agent.\nssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal Configure the ssh key pairs in ~/.ssh/config file Now the fun part. Every time you invoke a git request from your terminal, your git client will look for the private key (it will ask the ssh-agent) and use it to authenticate itself to Github git server. Since you’re having multiple key pairs how the git client would know it?\nIt turns out, when the git client invokes a git request using ssh protocol, it can look at a config file at ~/.ssh directory named config. If it’s not there already, create one. Create a file named \u0026ldquo;config\u0026rdquo; with the following content:\nHost company HostName github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa Host github.com HostName github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal Save it.\nNow company becomes a custom host name for the Github URL corresponding to your company Github account. Later as you will see, you will be naming your remote git repository in conjunction with this host name. In the configuration file, we map this custom host name to the id_rsa key.\nConfigure the git user name and email information This is important because you’re having two emails: personal and company. Github identifies the author of any commit from the email attached with the commit. We need to tell git the proper information for the author. You can use the git commands like the following:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34; git config --global user.email bob@company.com to configure the proper information. The option \u0026ndash;global can be substituted with \u0026ndash;system or \u0026ndash;local depending on your user case.\n-\u0026gt;In my case, the system-wide configuration is empty. I used the global configuration, so that if the local configuration is empty then the name and email are set to my name and my company email.\nA little bit about git configuration Git looks for the configuration information in 3 possible places:\nFirst, the system-wide /etc/gitconfig file, which contains settings that are applied to every user on the system and all of their repositories. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the \u0026ndash;system option.\nSecond, the ~/.gitconfig (or ~/.config/git/config) file, which is specific to each user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the \u0026ndash;global option.\nFinally, the .git/config file of whatever repository you’re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository only. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the \u0026ndash;local option. (If you don’t specify which level you want to work with, this is the default.)\nAs a rule of thumb, git always looks at things from the narrowest place which is local, then home, then system-wide.\nIn my case, the /etc/config is already set with my company account name and email so I will configure the user.name and user.email using \u0026ndash;local option.\nThe following command line will show all inherited values from: system, global and local\ngit config -l User case 1: you want to clone your company project from Github Let\u0026rsquo;s say your company Github repository URL is something like (you can get this URL from Github) Turn it into something that your local machine can understand it  Companies usually setup multiple repositories under a company repository name or a team repository name. In the command above, company-repo means the company repository name.\n Clone your company repository by running the following command:\ngit clone git@company:your-company-github-username/company-repo/remote-repo-name.git It should then clone the repository to a directory named \u0026ldquo;remote-repo-name\u0026rdquo; inside your current directory.\nUser case 2: your company project (on your local machine) is not tracked by git yet and you want to push it upstream Let’s say your company project is located in the \u0026ldquo;company-project\u0026rdquo; directory. On your terminal run the following commands:\ncd company-project git remote add origin git@company:your-company-github-username/company-repository.git git push origin master User case 3: your company project was cloned by using username/password authentication Run the following commands on your terminal:\ncd company-project git remote set-URL origin git@company:your-company-github-username/remote-repo-name.git Verify that the remote URL has changed:\ngit remote -v \u0026gt; origin git@company:your-company-github-username/remote-repo-name.git (fetch) \u0026gt; origin git@company:your-company-github-username/remote-repo-name.git (push) Where \u0026ldquo;remote-repo-name\u0026rdquo; is the name of your project’s repository on Github.\nUser case 4: you want to clone your personal project from Github Let\u0026rsquo;s say your personal Github repository URL is something like (you can get this URL from Github)\nTurn it into something that your local machine can understand it\nClone your company repository by running the following command:\ngit clone git@github.com:your-personal-github-username/remote-repo-name.git It should then clone the repository to a directory named \u0026ldquo;remote-repo-name\u0026rdquo; inside your current directory.\nGo into this directory and configure the user.name and user.email information. On your terminal, run the following commands:\ncd remote-repo-name git config --local user.name \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34; git config --local user.email bob@gmail.com  Because I already set the global configuration to my name and my company email. This local configuration is desirable.\n User case 5: your personal project (on your local machine) is not tracked by git yet and you want to push it upstream Let’s say your personal project is located in a directory named \u0026ldquo;my-repository\u0026rdquo; and you want to push it to Github using your personal Github account.\nGo into this directory and configure the user.name and user.email information. On your terminal, run the following commands:\ncd my-repository git config --local user.name \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34; git config --local user.email bob@gmail.com  Because I already set the global configuration to my name and my company email. This local configuration is desirable.\n Initialize a git repository inside it:\ncd my-repository git init Add necessary files to your staging area:\ngit add *  As an example, the command above adds all your project\u0026rsquo;s files to the staging area\n Make your first commit to your local repository\ngit commit -m \u0026#34;first commit\u0026#34; Now go to Github and create a new repository named \u0026ldquo;my-repository\u0026rdquo; using your personal Github account.\nNow go back to your terminal and run the following commands:\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:your-personal-github-username/my-repository.git git push origin master That’s all.
