      <description>While reading the Java language specification (JLS 14), I immediately pay attention to the chapter 5 where it describes how widening and narrowing for primitive data types works in Java. It&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in somethings that go behind the sense, somethings that are at a low level, for example things related to binary representation of data.
Java has the following primitive data types that are summarized in a table like so:</description>

      <description>A brief history of Unix It all started in 1969 when Ken Thompson wrote his game named Space Travel that simulates travel in the Solar System. He originally wrote it for use on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) operating system, but soon after Bell Labs pulled out of the Multics project, he rewrote it for the obsolete and little-used PDP-7 minicomputer that he found at his neighboring department. While writing this game on the PDP-7, he decided to implement his own base code libraries for the game to use including arithmetic, packages and graphics subsystem.</description>

      <title>Configure multiple Github accounts on a single machine</title>

      <description>Sooner or later as a developer, you will find yourself in a situation where you’re working using multiple Github accounts. One is your company account, one is your personal account. In this post, I’m going to share a common approach that can help you achieve that.
We will be using ssh as the protocol to authenticate our git requests to Github server because we do not want to enter the password each time we do a git request using username/password authentication.</description>

      <description>Best practice
 (My rule) Implement things following open source standard: for example how to implement a log client PECS - &amp;ldquo;Producer - Extends, Consumer - Super&amp;rdquo;: The Get and Put Principle: use an extends wildcard when you only get values our of a structure, use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure, and don&amp;rsquo;t use a wildcard you both get and put. (Java) Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s not a good practice to modify variables used in lambda expressions and anonymous classes.</description>

      <description>@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
  @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
  @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.</description>
